	<p style="padding-left: 75px; color: black;padding-right: 75px;">Music is an art form and cultural activity whose primary medium is sound.
	The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony),
    rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation),
     dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre 
     and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).
      Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit
      some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of 
      instruments and with vocal techniques ranging from singing to 
      rapping, and there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces
      (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that
      combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek
      μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses"). In its most general form,
      the activities describing music as an art form include the
      production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on
       ), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, 
      and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian
      philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as
      melodies and vertically as harmonies.</p>
